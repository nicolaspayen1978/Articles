        <p><strong>Positive Energy Ltd</strong> - a new way to support clean infrastructure development.</p>

        <h2>1. Make the invisible visible</h2>
        <p>Renewable Energy projects tend to be smaller than traditional power generation ones. Many represent an investment smaller than 100 million USD. Consequently, they attract less attention than large, flagship infrastructure projects like coal, gas, LNG, nuclear, dams, or offshore wind.</p>

        <p>Distributed projects are critical in the electrification of our societies. They provide clean power close to consumption points, enable communities to access energy, and allow commercial and industrial companies to reduce their energy costs, carbon intensity, and insecurity. The LCOE of solar projects now competes with new coal, even in emerging markets.</p>

        <p>SMEs developing and operating these renewable energy projects create local jobs. These national champions grow over time as successful energy services companies, propelled by a fast-growing market. The CAGR of RE is 6% globally and higher than 10% in Asia.</p>

        <p><strong>Positive Energy</strong>, with its digital platform, makes these smaller infrastructure projects visible to all stakeholders in the energy sector (regulators, NGOs, utilities, IPP, financiers, and service providers). They become an available alternative to traditional carbon-intensive investments.</p>

        <h2>2. Connect across borders</h2>
        <p>Oil majors have been growing across borders for decades, creating a strong cross-border ecosystem. To compete effectively, renewable energy players had to grow internationally early in their development.</p>

        <p>Recently, the growing number of RE100 and EV100 signatories—large international corporations—has accelerated this globalization. These companies pledge to use only renewable energy sources for their operations (RE100) or electric vehicles (EV100), driving large energy transition efforts along their supply chains.</p>

        <p>But deploying such programs at scale across various countries isn’t easy. There is growing competition for green/clean energy as local supply remains limited.</p>

        <p><strong>Positive Energy</strong> enables internationalization for any renewable energy player. The platform provides a way for local and regional champions to engage with international players. Our community of 1000+ users and 250+ companies forms a foundation for international collaboration around clean power project development, financing, and carbon offsetting programs.</p>

        <h2>3. e-Build capacity</h2>
        <p>In many emerging markets, renewable energy penetration remains low, and most countries struggle to increase the share of RE in the energy mix to 20–30%. While developed economies reduce dependence on coal, Asia now represents 80% of global coal demand.</p>

        <p>The main roadblocks to renewable energy development in these countries include inadequate regulatory frameworks, skills gaps, and lack of financing. Capacity development programs funded by institutions like the IEA, ADB, and IRENA help local stakeholders build the necessary skills and competencies.</p>

        <p><strong>Positive Energy</strong> plays a key role in helping local SMEs and new investors to build capabilities in this industry. Our platform is user-centric, designed based on feedback from investment analysts, fund managers, and committee members. Our standardized project information sheets, financial models, and virtual data room templates help developers understand investment requirements, organize their ideas, and assist new investors in this market more effectively.</p>

        <p>Through Positive Energy’s platform, preparing an investment file takes only a morning of work yet meets the expectations of large investors. Investors can quickly assess opportunities associated with these projects with just a few clicks.</p>

        <p><strong>We are running out of time.</strong> Emissions are not reducing. Global warming is progressing. Economic development remains the main priority, but renewable and energy efficiency programs offer developing countries the chance to build capacities in sustainable industries while improving their citizens' environments. <strong>Positive Energy</strong> provides a new approach and technology to support sustainable project development effectively.</p>
