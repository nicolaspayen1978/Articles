        <p>It is always <strong>entertaining to imagine what the future could be like</strong>. It is a part of my job that I enjoy very much. It is - I believe - an activity that everybody should practice. It only requires curiosity, audacity, and a playful mind.</p>

        <blockquote class="large-quote">"If you can dream it, you can do it." - Walt Disney</blockquote>

        <p>In recent years, <strong>creativity has gained more attention and respect in the business world</strong>. <br>PWC's 19th Annual Global CEO Survey reports that <strong>51% of CEOs are making significant changes to their organizations</strong> to better use digital technologies, ranking this as the most important driver for change according to the 2016 CEO survey.</p>

        <p>Many companies, faced with potential disruptions or opportunities associated with the <strong>digital world</strong>, have adopted new practices at the core of their strategy and execution. They embrace methods like <strong>design thinking</strong> or <strong>growth hacking</strong>, which rely heavily on creativity.</p>

        <h2>The Future of Jobs and Creativity</h2>
        <p>The World Economic Forum's <strong><a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2016/01/the-10-skills-you-need-to-thrive-in-the-fourth-industrial-revolution/">Future of Jobs Report</a></strong> confirms this trend. <strong style="font-size: 1.2em;">Creativity is set to become the #3 most desired skill by 2020</strong>, moving up from #10 in 2015. It will only be topped by critical thinking and the ability to solve complex problems.</p>
        <p>As a society, we need the private and public sectors to become more efficient innovators and value creators. In the past decade, <strong>productivity gains have slowed drastically.</strong></p>

        <p>We can hope this plateau of productivity is a precursor to major improvements driven by new digital technologies. Indeed the demography of our societies is going through a massive transformation. By 2050, there will be only <strong>3.5 working-age persons per person aged 65 or over</strong>, down from a <strong>7-to-1 ratio in 2015</strong>.This demographic shift implies we must double our productivity over the next 35 years, requiring a consistent productivity gain of at least 2% annually. If not then we may face a pauperization of our societies.</p>

        <p>People should not fear radical innovations like <strong>autonomous driving</strong>, <strong>artificial intelligence</strong>, or <strong>robotics</strong>, as long as they create societal value. We need these innovations to bridge the productivity gap.</p>

        <blockquote class="large-quote">"I have no special talents. I am only passionately curious." - Albert Einstein</blockquote>

        <p>At a time when society is calling for innovation and progress, and digital technologies offer more than ever, <strong>CREATIVITY remains one of the most crucial things we need</strong>.</p>
