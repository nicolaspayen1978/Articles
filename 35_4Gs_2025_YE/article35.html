  <section>

    <p>
      In 2023, I formalized my long-term investment thesis under what I call the <strong>4Gs portfolio</strong>.
      The framework is built around major societal, demographic, and technological transformations rather than short-term market cycles.
    </p>

    <h2>The 4Gs framework</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Grey:</strong> companies benefiting from ageing demographics.</li>
      <li><strong>Green (Climate Tech):</strong> companies supporting climate mitigation and the energy transition.</li>
      <li><strong>Generational / Gratification:</strong> companies focused on consumption, lifestyle, and entertainment.</li>
      <li><strong>Global:</strong> a geographically diversified portfolio, investing across the US, Europe, China, Japan, and emerging markets.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The strategy remained unchanged in 2025. What changed was the environment.</p>

    <h2>2025 performance overview</h2>

    <p>
      In 2025, the 4Gs portfolio delivered a <strong>total return of +12.4% in euro terms</strong>, including dividends.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Price return (ex-dividends): <strong>+10.3%</strong></li>
      <li>Dividend yield: <strong>~2.1% gross</strong></li>
      <li>S&amp;P 500 (USD): <strong>+16.4%</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      While the portfolio underperformed the S&amp;P 500 on a price basis, this comparison needs context:
      the 4Gs is a globally diversified, thematic portfolio, exposed to multiple currencies and sectors beyond US technology.
    </p>

    <h2>Performance by theme</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Grey (ageing population): +18.7%</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Green (Climate Tech): +7.2%</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Generational: +4.6%</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Gratification: –8.8%</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Global (non-US / non-EU): +11.6%</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Grey was the main contributor in 2025, while Climate Tech remained under pressure despite long-term fundamentals remaining intact.
    </p>

    <h2>Securities selection and investment process</h2>

    <p>
      The 4Gs portfolio follows a structured and repeatable investment process designed to balance conviction, diversification, and risk management.
    </p>

    <p>The process combines several complementary layers:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Universe research and quantitative screening:</strong>
        identification of potential investment candidates based on financial metrics, valuation, momentum, and liquidity.</li>

      <li><strong>Qualitative evaluation:</strong>
        in-depth analysis of business models, competitive positioning, management quality, and long-term structural relevance.</li>

      <li><strong>Sciences, society, and economic observation:</strong>
        continuous monitoring of demographic trends, technological shifts, regulatory changes, and macroeconomic forces.</li>

      <li><strong>Investment decision:</strong>
        position sizing based on conviction level, valuation, portfolio balance, and existing exposure.</li>

      <li><strong>Risk profile assessment:</strong>
        evaluation of downside risks at both security and portfolio levels, including concentration, sector, and currency exposure.</li>

      <li><strong>Ongoing performance and momentum review:</strong>
        monitoring of operating performance, market behavior, and relative momentum versus expectations.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This process is applied continuously, allowing the portfolio to evolve over time while remaining anchored to its long-term thematic foundations.
    </p>

    <h2>Key portfolio decisions</h2>

    <p>
      I initially planned to rebalance from Grey toward Climate Tech in the first half of 2025.
      Following the US election and the implementation of new tariffs, market conditions became exceptionally volatile.
      I therefore adopted a <em>wait-and-see</em> approach.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="large-quote">
      In hindsight, executing the rebalance earlier would likely have improved 2025 performance — but discipline and risk management mattered more than “being right”.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The rebalance was ultimately executed in Q4 2025 by trimming the portfolio’s largest holding, <strong>EssilorLuxottica</strong>, and reallocating toward Climate Tech.
      This was primarily a concentration risk decision rather than a change in conviction.
    </p>

    <p>
      2025 also marked a structural adjustment with approximately <strong>16% of the portfolio allocated to high-yield equities</strong>,
      mainly within specialized REITs (Grey) and yield-oriented Climate Tech companies.
      This was both a defensive and valuation-driven choice.
    </p>

    <h2>Top contributors and detractors</h2>

    <p>
      Strongest contributors included T1 Energy, GigaCloud, GE Vernova, Vestas, Alibaba, Alphabet, Aurubis, Baidu, Tencent,
      Brookfield Renewable, Ventas, Panasonic, HASI, LONGi, and EssilorLuxottica.
    </p>

    <p>
      The weakest performers were Ørsted, XPLR Infrastructure, Pernod Ricard, and JD.com.
    </p>

    <h2>Currency impact</h2>

    <p>Foreign exchange had a material impact on euro-denominated returns:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>GBP/EUR: –5.2%</li>
      <li>CNY/EUR: –8%</li>
      <li>EUR/USD: +13.5%</li>
      <li>EUR/JPY: +12%</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      With more than 60% of the portfolio denominated in USD, FX movements were a meaningful headwind in 2025.
    </p>

    <h2>Multi-year performance and benchmarks</h2>

    <p>
      To put the 2025 results into perspective, it is useful to look at the portfolio’s performance over several years and across market cycles.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>2023:</strong> 4Gs (EUR) +19% vs S&amp;P 500 +24%, Nasdaq 100 +49%</li>
      <li><strong>2024:</strong> 4Gs (EUR) +25% vs S&amp;P 500 +24%, Nasdaq 100 +29%</li>
      <li><strong>2025:</strong> 4Gs (EUR) +10% vs S&amp;P 500 +16%</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Over the same period, individual themes evolved as follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Grey:</strong> +11% (2023), +22% (2024), +19% (2025)</li>
      <li><strong>Green:</strong> +25% (2023), +32% (2024), +7% (2025)</li>
      <li><strong>Gratification / Generational:</strong> +4% / +53% (2023), 0% / +35% (2024), –9% / +5% (2025)</li>
      <li><strong>Global:</strong> –11% (2023), +14% (2024), +12% (2025)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      From an initial reference value of <strong>€100</strong>, the portfolio reached approximately <strong>€164</strong> by the end of 2025.
      The corresponding total return index (TRI), including reinvested dividends, stands at approximately <strong>+21%</strong> over the three-year period.
    </p>

    <h2>Reflections and outlook</h2>

    <p>
      2025 reinforced the importance of staying focused on fundamentals and portfolio design during volatile periods.
      It also highlighted areas for improvement, notably the need to cut underperforming positions more decisively.
    </p>

    <p>
      I continue to view the energy transition as one of the most compelling long-term investment opportunities.
      Looking into 2026, the strategy remains unchanged, with dividends reinvested selectively and close attention paid to valuation, risk concentration, and macro uncertainty.
    </p>

    <p>
      Long-term investing is not about avoiding volatility, but about navigating it with discipline.
