        <p>I enjoy running; I try to do it regularly. When I run, I notice my mind gains clarity, and my decisions improve. During one of my recent long runs, I thought about my journey as an entrepreneur and how difficult it can be for people to understand what it entails. The analogy with WWII gliders came to mind, mainly because I had to land my start-up to avoid crashing as I ran out of fuel. These gliders were towed into the air during D-day and then released, relying solely on aerodynamics and the skill of the pilot to reach their destination.</p>

        <p>Embarking on the journey of a start-up is akin to piloting an aircraft on an ambitious expedition into uncharted skies. It begins with a bold vision of reaching new horizons—a destination of innovation, success, and impact. But unlike conventional flights, there isn’t a fully assembled plane waiting on the tarmac. Instead, you start with the skeleton of an idea, assembling the aircraft as you accelerate down the runway.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Flight Plan as Business Strategy</h3> 
        Before any flight takes off, a meticulous <strong>flight plan</strong> is crafted. This document outlines the route, altitude, fuel requirements, weather considerations, and contingency plans. Similarly, a start-up requires a well-thought-out business strategy. This plan maps out your goals, target market, financial projections, competitive analysis, and risk management strategies. It’s your roadmap to navigate the vast and often turbulent skies of the business world.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Assembling on the Runway: Building the MVP</h3>
        With limited resources, you and your team hastily construct the basic framework needed for takeoff—your minimum viable product (MVP).
