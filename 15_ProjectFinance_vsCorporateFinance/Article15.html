        <h2>1. Why Project Finance vs. Corporate Finance?</h2>
        <p>This article provides the elements to reflect on the type of financing associated with an investment in the renewable energy sector.</p>
        <p><strong>Positive Energy Ltd</strong> decided to focus on project financing and not corporate financing very early in its journey for multiple reasons. This document explains why “Project Financing” is the most suitable way for impact investors to allocate capital to decarbonization initiatives.</p>
        <p>This paper takes a helicopter view on the topic. It does not go into the differences between the financing of solar, wind, biomass, waste-to-energy, hydropower, energy efficiency, and energy storage projects.</p>

        <h3>1.1 Typical developer company structure</h3>
        <p>To protect the development company from bankruptcy, if one of the projects owned or developed by the development company failed, the renewable energy project developers would create one or several asset project companies to hold their assets.</p>
        <p>The typical structure of a developer is the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Development company:</strong> this legal entity hosts the operations of the developers (salary of employees, marketing, sales, engineering, company IP).</li>
            <li><strong>Asset project company:</strong> this legal entity isolates a project from the development company. The asset project companies are typically Special Purpose Vehicles (SPV).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The development company is then a majority or minority shareholder of the asset project companies. The development company can also provide shareholder loans to the asset project companies or owns a specific class of shares to replicate a debt structure.</p>
        <p>If a developer operates internationally, it will most likely create legal structures that match its scope. This will result in the following structure:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Development holding company</strong> that owns local development companies in the countries of operations.</li>
            <li><strong>Asset holding company</strong> that owns the different asset project companies located in the countries of the projects.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>

        </p>

        <h3>1.2 How do developers finance projects?</h3>
        <p>If a developer wants to finance the development and construction of a decarbonization infrastructure project, then the development company has different options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Corporate financing:</strong> Secure equity or debt financing at the development company level and then finance the development or construction of the project on its balance sheet.</li>
            <li><strong>Project financing:</strong> Secure equity or debt financing at the project company level to finance the project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>“Project financing” often refers to the debt financing of infrastructure projects at the Asset Project Company level. It is the most common way used by banks to finance larger infrastructure projects.</p>
        <p>Corporations can use Green bonds to raise money to finance projects. The development company more often issues green bonds, but the Asset Holding company can also issue them.</p>
        <p>The typical equity/debt ratio used for Project Finance is much higher than for Corporate finance.In Europe, Solar or Wind project can be up to 90-95% debt-financed. The typical range for the debt-to-equity ratio in a project company is 50% to 95%.</p>

        <h3>1.3 Asset company structure typology</h3>
        <p>Large projects will always have their own SPV. This is mandatory to get debt for your project from banks. SPVs are used in all countries.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, it is common that investors request a specific investor-friendly and tax-friendly jurisdiction for the SPV used to inject the investment. For example, many projects in South Asia will have both a local and Singaporean SPV.</p>
        <p>Smaller projects can be aggregated/pooled in a single SPV. Nevertheless, it is important to ensure that the projects included in an SPV share the same risk and return profile to make the debt project financing possible and fair. It is common to group small Solar rooftop projects in a single SPV.A developer may also group solar rooftop projects based on some criteria:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Off-taker credit risk</li>
            <li>Off-take agreement type</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Project Finance deal vs. Corporate Finance deal</h2>
        <p>This section looks at the differences between corporate finance and a project finance deal.</p>
        <p>For every project finance transaction or M&A deal, the investor needs to perform the four following things:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Identify and evaluate risks</li>
            <li>Value entreprise and define pricing for the deal</li>
            <li>Structure the deal and associated collaterals/guarantees</li>
            <li>Evaluate impacts</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Depending on the type of financing used, the work will be different. Let’s compare and benchmark corporate vs. project financing.</p>

        <h3>2.1 Risks assessment</h3>
        <p>The complexity of assessing risks associated with an investment is higher at the corporate level than at the project level.</p>
        <p>When investing at the corporate level, it is common for investors to ensure that the development company will use similar contracts and agreements to limit variability in the risk profiles.</p>
        <p>The scope of the assessment will be different for project financing or corporate financing. Below is a non-exhaustive list of items that comes into the picture for the pricing.</p>
        <p>
         <!-- Image Example with Caption -->
        <figure>
            <img src="image\risks.png" alt="risks analysis, project finance vs corporate finance" style="max-width:100%; height:auto; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0px 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            <figcaption>risks analysis, project finance vs corporate finance</figcaption>
        </figure> 
        </p>
        <p>It is possible to standardize and create relatively simple financial models to perform a DCF analysis of a single asset (greenfield or brownfield). Such models make the pricing of the Project Finance deal relatively easy.</p>
        <p>The complexity of pricing a deal at the corporate level is much higher. Investors often need to use other valuation methodologies based on multiples as advanced financial modeling may be too complex or expansive to achieve.</p>
        <p>A development company typically has several operational projects and a pipeline of possible projects they want to develop/build in the future. The valuation of this pipeline is also a tricky exercise. The big four audit companies publish some papers on how to value projects inside a portfolio depending on their maturity stage. But it means the buy-side will have to run a due diligence process on all underlying assets under development or built by the development company to price the deal correctly. The development company has most likely built some brand equity and some Intellectual Property (IP) over time. As a result, these intangible assets need to be fairly valued to match the developer’s expectations.</p>
        <p>Consequently, it can be harder to align on a fair price between a developer and an investor for a corporate finance deal.</p>

        <h3>2.2 Pricing</h3>
        <p>The investor needs to price the asset to invest. A lender will also need to perform a financial analysis to size the debt financing effectively and understand the risk profile to define the correct premium.</p>
        <p>The scope of the assessment will be different for project financing or corporate financing. Below is a non-exhaustive list of items that comes into the picture for the pricing.</p>
        <p>
         <!-- Image Example with Caption -->

        <p><strong>The complexity of pricing a deal at the corporate level is much higher</strong>. Investors often need to use other valuation methodologies based on multiples as advanced financial modeling may be too complex or expansive to achieve.A development company typically has several operational projects and a pipeline of possible projects they want to develop/build in the future. <strong>The valuation of this pipeline is also a tricky exercise.</strong></p>

        <p>Consequently, it can be harder to align on a fair price between a developer and an investor for a corporate finance deal.</p>

        <h3>2.3 Structuration with collaterals/guarantees</h3>
        <p>Debt project financing is an effective way to invest and secure debt investment. In case of single project default, the most senior lender of this project will be in the best position to recover part of its investment.Other actors and especially the equity ones will end up in a tricky position.</p>
        <p>
         <!-- Image Example with Caption -->
        <figure>
            <img src="image\collaterals.png" alt="structuration project finance vs corporate finance" style="max-width:100%; height:auto; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0px 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            <figcaption>structuration, project finance vs corporate finance</figcaption>
        </figure>
        </p> 
        <p>When a company uses different debt instruments at the Corporate and Project level, it can become very complex to understand which actors get priority in case of default. A detailed analysis of the different shareholder agreements, the loan agreements, and the local regulation will have to be done to understand the situation clearly. The complexity of structuring an equity deal at the corporate level is similar to an equity deal at the project level. Nevertheless, the number of stakeholders involved at the corporate level tends to be higher. This can make the discussion more difficult and reduce the investors’ negotiation power when discussing the deal terms. The development company shareholders may also be more sensitive to dilution at the corporate level than at the project level.</p>
        </p>Again, the complexity of structuring a deal is much higher at the corporate level than at the project level.</p>

        <h3>2.4 Impacts evaluation</h3>
        <p>With the growing concerns about Climate Change, most investors want to measure more effectively the negative and positive impact of their investments to ensure they translate into the positive changes they support.</p>
        <p>Most advanced investors will measure the returns for their investments not only in financial terms but also for their environmental, social, economic, and governance attributes (ESG).</p>
        <p>Positive Energy Ltd supports the financing of decarbonization power projects to support climate change mitigation through tangible emissions reduction. In collaboration with the Steward Red Queen (SRQ), Positive Energy Ltd developed a simple ESG assessment framework to help investors assess the impacts of renewable energy project investment opportunities.</p>
        <p>In the table below, we review the differences in scope between impact assessment at the project and corporate level.</p>
         <p>
         <!-- Image Example with Caption -->
        <figure>
            <img src="image\impacts.png" alt="impacts analysis, project finance vs corporate finance" style="max-width:100%; height:auto; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0px 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            <figcaption>impacts analysis, project finance vs corporate finance</figcaption>
        </figure>
        </p> 
        <p>The evaluation of the impact of the invested funds is simpler and more accurate at the project level than at the corporate level. There is also less overhead included in the financing. Indeed, project finance is an effective way to control the usage of funds. The funds can be made available step-by-step according to the project development and construction progress. By doing so, the impact investors can maximize their impact per capital deployed. They can also be more selective in the types of projects they support.</p>



        <h2>3. Advantage project finance</h2>
        <p><strong>To simplify the execution of the deals and manage their asset portfolio, we recommend that impact investors invest at the project level and not the corporate level.</strong></p>
        <p>We recommend that investors use similar approach/structuring as a bank when providing debt project financing. But impact investors can bring additional values than banks to the project. For example, investors can be faster in making investment decisions, accept to come earlier into the project lifecycle, support more impactful or innovative projects, be more flexible with the credit assessment of the project sponsor.</p>
        <p>Equity Corporate Finance deals can offer more securities to the equity investors as all the underlying assets of the development company can be used as collateral. To compensate for this, project equity investors can use – if necessary – warrants (at the corporate level) to ensure that they will be compensated in case of a default event at a single project level.</p>
        <p>Investing at the project level also allows investors to capitalize fully on the PEL digital platform that simplifies through standardization and automation the project level investment process.</p>
