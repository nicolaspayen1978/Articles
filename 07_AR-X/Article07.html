        <p>In this post, we will introduce what we believe will be the next evolution of the AR/VR market: the Augmented Experience (AR-X). AR-X is an emerging mode for augmenting the physical world beyond the current use of flat screens and smart glasses. For example, interactive projections, smart objects, voice, and audio. We will explain that the success of mobile applications like Pokemon Go suggests that AR applications on mobile devices will lead to the mass adoption of the AR-X market (cf. investment plan announced by Mark Zuckerberg).</p>

        <h2>Augmented and Virtual Reality: State of the Union</h2>
        <p>2016 was a special year for AR and VR. The combined market grew aggressively, reaching $3.9 billion. The volume of VR units sold was strong but below the ambitions of the major corporations behind it (Facebook, Sony, Samsung, Microsoft). Selling millions of units is not enough for these players, who are looking for numbers in the billions of recurrent users. At the same time, in 2016, thanks to Pokemon Go and its 650 million downloads, AR made an outstanding performance far above expectations. It demonstrated that tablets and smartphones had the potential to drive the mass adoption of AR applications. Mobile APP-based AR presents a set of unique advantages:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Removes the entry cost to experience AR. Everyone has a smartphone nowadays.</li>
            <li>Provides direct access to a massive installed base of potential users.</li>
            <li>Offers a socially accepted way to consume digital content, as people are accustomed to seeing others with their phones in various settings. Thereâ€™s no need for users to wear awkward AR devices or isolate themselves from the world with a VR unit.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This success with Pokemon Go was enough to convince most players (Apple, Facebook, Samsung, and Google) to reinforce their investments in mobile AR.</p>

        <h2>From Mobile AR to Augmented Experience (AR-X)</h2>
        <p>AR-X extends the concept of AR by making it more ubiquitous yet less intrusive. Consumers do not need to use their own devices to experience AR-X; even passive customers can be activated by interactive projections or audio.</p>

        <p>AR-X leverages additional media to augment the world around you, such as animated digital projections, voice-enabled devices, and smart/IoT devices. We believe AR-X technology represents a new way to engage with customers. This form of communication is highly contextual and personalized but effortless for the customer.</p>

        <p>The following <strong><a ref="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTiK3Df0PJQ">video demonstrates a simple implementation of the Augmented Experience (AR-X) concept </a></strong>by creating a brand new interactive interface. This prototype was realized by a US creative agency called argodesign.</p>

        <p>The AR-X concept and this article are the outcomes of research work done by Nicolas Payen (Founder of the Future Economy Studio) and Gregory Cornelius (founder of Protiotype).</p>
